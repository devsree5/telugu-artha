# telugu-artha
Project Name: <b>Viswambhara</b><br>
I believe that telugu is the one language that is used for writing(documenting), speaking and musical rules.<br>
I believe that this can improved using latest technologies.<br>

Inspired by C.Narayana Reddy Sahityam<br>
Inspired by Satya Nadella's Statement "Empower every individual and every organisation to achieve more"<br>
Inspired by my telugu teachers, many poets(Sri sri, Srinathudu, Jashua, Veeresalingam, Viswantah satyanarayana) and <b>many nice people</b>.<br>
We want empower telugu people to use their language in tech<br>
